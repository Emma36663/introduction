# introduction
#Hello My name is Emma Jiang, and I am currently a high schooler.
My hobbits include playing volleyball(for 5 years), dancing(ballet for 9 years and currently trying Jazz), reading detective novels(I enjoy reading Sherlock Holmes, The Murder On the Orient Express, and And Then There Were None),and Chinese calligraphy.
Currently, my dream major is bioinformatics, as I'm really passion and curious towards biology and programming.
