# introduction
#Hello My name is Emma Jiang, and I am currently a high schooler at Shanghai Montverde School. 

My hobbits include playing volleyball(for 5 years), dancing(ballet for 9 years and currently trying Jazz), reading detective novels(I enjoy reading Sherlock Holmes, The Murder On the Orient Express, and And Then There Were None),and Chinese calligraphy. 

I enjoy participating in charity events, such as tutoring peers (related to Algebra 2 and Precalculus) and primary school kids (about English and floristry). I also participate as a volunteer in Shanghai Fudan Hospital (for 50+ hours).

Currently, my dream major is bioinformatics, as I'm really passion and curious towards biology and programming. I would like to go to America for college.
